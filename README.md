A do over of the original Gnar game


Orginial Gnar game had some issues... It was pretty poorly thought out / designed and also 
featured no documentation. 
I'm rewriting the game from the ground up because I want to finish the game, but don't
want to continue working on the original files... So I'm rewriting it 
with actual best practice OOP styles. 

This game also implements a GUI instead of just using the CLI.
